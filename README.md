# cool-html-designs
Hello everybody , i am an amateur who has started learning html and css coding like 10 days ago . 
This is my first project or challenge which i have completed with all the knowledge i have of both html and css
.To complete this challenge i have made two pages firstly 'qr code with the simplest html coding possible' and second is 'qr.css' 
.The former one is where the main content is i.e. the Qr code and some written content , while the later one is where i have tried 
to design the layout of the main page
.I hope you would be able to understand it clearly and would help me to improve by giving  your feedbacks
ThanksüòÅ
